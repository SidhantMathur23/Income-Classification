## Problem Statement 
In this project, we will be implementing a use case of machine learning in the field of Personal Finances and Banking. With this data, we are tasked with predicting whether a person makes more than $50K/year.

## Project Description
#### About the Data
The datast was taken from the 1994 census database and it consists of 32561 entries with 16 columns. The data stores various kinds of variables, 8 categorical(including the target variable) and 8 numeric variables. The target variable, labelled as "income" consists of 2 class labels, ">50K" and "<=50K". The dataset contains a class imbalance, so performany metrics like F1 score will be profoundly used as a basis to evaluate the estimator models



## Project Setup
The project contains several external libraries which are not availible with the stndard anaconda download, these libraries are going to have be downloaded by the user. Navigate to the anaconda prompt and enter the following commands 
```python
pip install datawig
pip install category_encoders
pip install warnings
```
